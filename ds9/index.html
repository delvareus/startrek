	<h2 id="URAR">Understanding Ratings and Recommendations</h2>

	<p>
		Everyone has different tastes and opinions, and my opinions certainly aren't always popular. To help combat that, a &quot;final score&quot; on any episode is an average of my rating and the ratings from 3 other independent sources, including IMDB. Though, my rating is weighted a little higher in that calculation, because this is my website, after all. In addition to the ratings, I also provide a &quot;Watch Recommendation&quot; which doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the quality of the episode. Rather, the watch recommendation is based on how important the episode is to the overall story of the entire series, whether that episode is good or bad. See below for more details.

				These are awarded to what I consider to be the best episodes in the series, but that are also representative of the series. This means that I generally won't award them to &quot;special&quot; episodes. For instance, in the case of Deep Space Nine, episodes like <em>Trials and Tribble-ations</em> or <em>Far Beyond the Stars</em>, wouldn't be considered for these despite being really good episodes.

			<th colspan=2>Category</th>
			<th>Description</th>
			<th># of episodes in DS9</th>
		<tr>
			<td style="text-align:center;font-size:x-large">‼</td>
			<td style="font-size:large">BARE MINIMUM</td>
			<td>
				This track is designed for someone who really has no intention to watch the show, but would like the bare-minimum experience to get the &quot;gist&quot; of the series from beginning to end. It will usually include the series premiere, the series finale, and a smattering of episodes in between. Episodes in this track are almost always also in the &quot;Must Watch&quot; category, but not always. This track doesn't always include high-scoring or iconic episodes; it focuses instead on giving you the quickest glimpse into the important elements to the overall story arc of the entire series.

		<tr>
			<td style="text-align:center;font-size:x-large">🕶</td>
			<td style="font-size:large">MUST WATCH</td>
			<td>
				This category is for viewers who are willing to watch more than the minimum, but who still only want to see the most important and most iconic episodes of a series. This track fills out a lot more of the gaps in the story-telling than the &quot;Bare Minimum&quot; track does. &quot;Must Watch&quot; episodes aren't always just the best, highly-rated episodes. This track includes episodes that are the most <em>important</em> for understaning the overall story arc of the series, and that may include some low-rated, &quot;not great&quot; episodes.

				&quot;Highly Recommended&quot; episodes are usually ones that are highly-rated but aren't necessarily important to the overall story arc of the entire series. You could probably skip these without missing any important plot points, but you might be missing out on a really good episode.

				If you're looking for even more episodes to watch, this recommended list is the place to go. These are episodes that are usually average or above-average, and they might provide more in-depth details about characters and events, but they aren't necessarily crucial to understanding the entire series.
